# JASP_Another_Json_Scala_Parser
It's a Scala Json parser. It parses JSON, and create Map , Arrays and String and Numbers and Booleans embedded in them. It' supposed to be functional in nature, so no mutation. Also it's to support streaming which is work progress, getting immutability and streaming is a tough nut to work out together.
